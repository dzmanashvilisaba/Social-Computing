## Lab 4
In Lab4, it was practiced the concepts of sampling distribution step-by-step: given population size, 10k, of KAIST students and their height measures (theoritical values) it is estimated:
  1.  The distribution of a histogram of population and its form
  2.  The mean and standartand diviation of sampling and population distribution, and difference between those two
  3.  Difference measure between POSTECH student's data

## Project
### Effects of Automatization on Jobs and Employment
This project was to investigate the effects of technology development and automatization of skills on jobs and employment of people. For that purpose the following methodology was used:
  1.  Collected and determined the global employemnt measures according to the industry sectors and general jobs (729 job names)
  2.  Collected and determined the description of each job, and given to it necessary skills to execute those jobs
  3.  Using Text Classifier (Online) determined how much of these jobs need those particular skills (percentage %)
  4.  Using past 30 years of data used ARIMA prediciton model to forecast following 10 yeears of data.
  5.  Given estimated possible employment measure in 10 years, and possible automatability of each jobs, adding few more assumptions, the percent of automated jobs was estimated
