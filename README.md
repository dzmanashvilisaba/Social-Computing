## Lab 4
In Lab4, it was practiced the concepts of sampling distribution: given population size, 10k, of KAIST students and their height measures (theoritical values) it is estimated:
  1.  The distribution of a histogram of data and form of distribution.
  2.  The mean and standartand diviation of sampling and population distribution.
  3.  Difference measure between KAIST and POSTECH student's data.

## Project
### Effects of Automatization on Jobs and Employment
This project was to investigate the effects of technology development and automatization on jobs and employment of people. For that purpose the following methodology was used:
  1.  Collected and determined the global employemnt measures according to the industry sectors and general jobs (729 job names)
  2.  Collected and determined the description of each job, and characterized each by ceartain skills to execute those jobs
  3.  Using Text Classifier (Online) determined the degree of involvment of those particular skills in these jobs percentagewise
  4.  Used past 30 years of data of employment and ARIMA prediciton model to forecast following 10 yeears of employment data industrywise and jobwise.
  5.  Given estimated possible employment measure in 10 years, and possible automatability of each jobs, additionally including few more assumptions, the percent of automated jobs was estimated
